# Security Best Practices

This document summarizes the **best security practices** for a **CI/CD** pipeline using **GitHub**, **ArgoCD**, **Google Artifact Registry**, and **GKE**, and also covers the security  for the  infrastructure in a production environment.

## 1. GitHub (Repositories and CI Pipeline)

- **Branch protection** and the use of **pull requests** for approving changes.
- **Two-factor authentication (2FA)** for all users.
- **GitHub Secrets** to securely store sensitive credentials and regular key rotation.
- **Vulnerability scanning** in Docker images with **Trivy** or **Synk**.

## 2. Google Artifact Registry

- **Automatic vulnerability scanning** with Google Container Analysis.

## 3. ArgoCD

- Authentication with **SSO/OIDC** and access control using **RBAC**.
- **TLS** for secure communication between ArgoCD, GitHub, and Kubernetes.
- **Audit logs** to track actions and deployments.

## 4. GCP and Kubernetes Cluster (GKE)

- **Private nodes** without public IP addresses and restricted SSH access.
- **PodSecurity** and **Network Policies** to restrict permissions and inter-Pod communications.
- **Encryption of secrets**.
- Use of **RBAC** to limit permissions within the cluster.
- Access control with **Google Cloud IAM**
- **Service accounts**: Use dedicated service accounts for applications, and avoid using the default service accounts with broad permissions.
- **Audit IAM roles**: Regularly review and audit IAM roles to ensure no over-privileged access is granted.
- **Firewall rules**: Use **firewall rules** to restrict traffic, only allowing the necessary internal and external communications.
- **Cloud Armor**: Implement **Google Cloud Armor** to protect against DDoS attacks.

## 5. GitOps Process

- Automatic validation of manifests before deployment.
- **Automatic rollback** in case of deployment failures.

These measures collectively ensure a secure  **CI/CD infrastructure** and process, mitigating risks such as unauthorized access, vulnerabilities and infrastructure failures in production.
